# Awesome AI Harness [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> The model is the engine. The **harness** is the car.

A curated list of resources on **harness engineering** — the discipline of building the runtime scaffolding that turns a language model into a working agent.

[中文版 →](README.zh-CN.md)

---

## Why this list

Most "awesome agent" lists catalogue *frameworks*. This one is about the layer underneath: the concrete engineering decisions that determine whether an agent works or flails.

A frontier model dropped into a bad harness behaves like a bad model. It loops, forgets, calls the wrong tool, burns its context on noise, and gives up. The same model in a good harness plans, recovers from errors, and finishes. **The gap between those two outcomes is harness engineering**, and almost none of it is in the model weights.

The craft is young, the knowledge is scattered across engineering blogs and leaked system prompts, and there is no textbook. This is an attempt at a map.

**Scope note:** this list covers the *inference-time* harness. Harnesses that double as RL training environments (environment hubs, trajectory generation, reward design) are a sibling discipline we deliberately leave out.

## What is a harness?

Everything between the user's intent and the model's next token:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    U([User intent]) --> H
    subgraph H[The Harness]
        direction TB
        SP[System prompt<br/>role, rules, environment]
        CTX[Context assembly<br/>budget · retrieval · compaction]
        TOOL[Tool layer<br/>definitions · results · errors]
        LOOP[Agent loop<br/>plan → act → observe → repeat]
        MEM[Memory &amp; state<br/>files · sessions · scratchpads]
        GATE[Permissions &amp; sandbox<br/>allowlists · HITL gates]
    end
    H <--> M{{Model}}
    H --> W([Effects on the world])
```

The model is a stateless function. Every bit of statefulness, safety, memory, and competence an "agent" appears to have was engineered into the loop around it.

## Foundations

Start here if you are new to the field.

- [Harness Engineering for Self-Improvement](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2026-07-04-harness/) — Lilian Weng. The most complete map of the discipline to date: three design patterns (workflow automation, filesystem-as-memory, sub-agents and backend jobs), a coding-agent case study, where the harness layer ends and core intelligence begins, and the case for harnesses that optimize themselves through evolutionary search. If you read one thing on this list, read this.
- [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) — Anthropic. The canonical starting point. Argues most "agents" should be workflows, and defines the vocabulary (chaining, routing, orchestrator-workers, evaluator-optimizer) the rest of the field now uses.
- [How to Build an Agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) — Thorsten Ball. A working code agent in ~300 lines. The single best cure for the belief that agents are magic; it is a loop, a list of tools, and good plumbing.
- [Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html) — Chip Huyen. Systematic breakdown of planning, tool use, and failure modes.
- [Don't Build Multi-Agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents) — Cognition. The dissenting case: context fragmentation across agents is the dominant failure mode. Read alongside the multi-agent section below.
- [A Practical Guide to Building Agents](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf) — OpenAI (PDF).

### Terminology

The field's vocabulary is still settling; these pin it down.

- [Harness, Scaffold, and the AI Agent Terms Worth Getting Right](https://huggingface.co/blog/agent-glossary) — Hugging Face. The glossary that draws the harness/scaffold/framework lines, and bridges harness vocabulary to the RL-environment world.
- [Agent harness vs. agent framework](https://arize.com/blog/what-is-an-agent-harness-why-harnesses-are-replacing-agent-frameworks/) — Arize. Why "harness" is displacing "framework": the harness owns the loop, the framework only lends you parts.
- [Agent Engineering](https://www.latent.space/p/agent) — swyx. Names the job title and surveys its surface area, including the auth/identity layer most taxonomies forget.

### Design patterns & surveys

- [From Question Answering to Task Completion: A Survey on Agent System and Harness Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.20683) — The academic survey of harness design proper; enumerates the six runtime responsibilities (session state, context budgeting, tool dispatch, provider abstraction, permissions, recovery) every harness must answer.
- [Agentic Design Patterns: A System-Theoretic Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19752) — A pattern catalog that treats the harness as a system with feedback loops, not a prompt with plumbing.

## Context Engineering

The context window is the agent's entire working memory, and it is a scarce, actively-managed resource. This is where most harness quality lives.

- [Context Engineering for AI Agents: Lessons from Building Manus](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus) — Manus. The most-cited practitioner text on the subject: design around the KV-cache (stable prefix, append-only history), mask tool logits instead of removing tools, use the filesystem as unbounded context, recite goals into the recency window, and keep failures in context so the model learns from them.
- [Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) — Anthropic. Treats context as a finite budget; covers just-in-time retrieval, compaction, and structured note-taking.
- [Context Rot: How Increasing Input Tokens Impacts LLM Performance](https://www.trychroma.com/research/context-rot) — Chroma. The measurement study: performance degrades non-uniformly as input grows, even on trivial tasks — the empirical case for everything else in this section.
- [Context Engineering](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/27/context-engineering/) — Simon Willison. Short piece that popularized the term over "prompt engineering."
- [How Long Contexts Fail](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html) — Drew Breunig. Names four failure modes: poisoning, distraction, confusion, clash. Essential vocabulary.
- [How to Fix Your Context](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html) — Drew Breunig. The companion remedies: RAG, tool loadout, quarantine, pruning, summarization, offloading.
- [A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13334) — The canonical academic formalization (note it defines the term far more broadly than practitioners do). [全文中文翻译](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1934605504165950750) available on 知乎.
- [Lost in the Middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) — Why position in context matters, and why "just use a long context" fails.

- [Managing Context on the Claude Developer Platform](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management) — Anthropic. Context editing and the memory tool as first-class API primitives.
- [Why Cline Doesn't Index Your Codebase](https://cline.bot/blog/why-cline-doesnt-index-your-codebase-and-why-thats-a-good-thing) — Cline. The case against RAG-for-code: agentic grep + read beats embeddings on freshness, security surface, and truthfulness.
- [Building a better repository map with tree-sitter](https://aider.chat/2023/10/22/repomap.html) — Aider. The opposite bet from Cline's: a compact, always-present structural map of the repo, built from AST symbols and ranked by graph centrality.
- [AI Agent 上下文工程：LangChain & Manus 研讨会全记录](https://liduos.com/posts/langchain-manus-agent-context-engineering-workshop) — 中文. LangChain × Manus workshop notes pairing the two teams' context strategies side by side.

## Tool Design & Agent-Computer Interfaces

Tools are the agent's API to reality. Their names, schemas, return values, and error messages are prompt engineering by another name — and the interface design is worth more than a model upgrade.

- [Writing Effective Tools for Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents) — Anthropic. The best single reference: consolidate tools, return token-efficient results, make errors instructive, namespace clearly.
- [SWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793) — Coins "agent-computer interface" and shows interface design is worth more than model swaps. Arguably the foundational harness-engineering paper.
- [We removed 80% of our agent's tools](https://vercel.com/blog/we-removed-80-percent-of-our-agents-tools) — Vercel. The reduction experiment taken to its end: replace a wall of bespoke tools with a terminal and watch reliability go up.

- [Code Mode: the better way to use MCP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/) — Cloudflare. The same conclusion reached independently: agents write TypeScript against tool APIs in an isolate, because models are better at code than at tool-call JSON.
- [The "Think" Tool](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool) — Anthropic. A no-op tool that buys deliberation mid-loop. Elegant demonstration that tools shape cognition, not just capability.
- [Toolformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) — Where tool-use research started: models teaching themselves when to call APIs.
- [MCP Reference Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) — Read these as worked examples of tool schema design.

- [Rebuilding Devin for Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://cognition.com/blog/devin-sonnet-4-5-lessons-and-challenges) — Cognition. Model-harness coupling in the wild: the same harness needed rework for a new model's "context anxiety" and tool-preference quirks — harnesses are becoming model-version-specific artifacts.
- [Interleaved Thinking Unlocks Reliable Agentic Capability](https://www.minimax.io/news/why-is-interleaved-thinking-important-for-m2) — MiniMax. Why the harness must preserve thinking blocks between turns, and what breaks when it doesn't.
- [Droid: #1 on Terminal-Bench](https://factory.ai/news/terminal-bench) — Factory. A harness team's account of what loop-level engineering (not model choice) bought them on a hard benchmark.

- [Antibrittle Agents](https://www.southbridge.ai/blog/antibrittle-agents) — Southbridge. Designing loops that degrade gracefully instead of shattering on the first unexpected state.

## Memory, State & Session Resume

- [MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560) — Virtual-memory paging applied to the context window. The paper that made "memory hierarchy" the default frame.

- [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) — Memory layer with extraction/consolidation pipelines; the [companion paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19413) reports strong latency and benchmark numbers (self-reported — treat vendor-run memory benchmarks with appropriate skepticism, here and everywhere).
- [Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) — Temporally-aware knowledge graphs as agent memory: facts carry validity intervals, so the memory can answer "what was true when."
- [Are We Ready For An Agent-Native Memory System?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.24775) — Argues bolted-on memory stores miss what agents actually need; a good map of the design space.
- [Crab: A Semantics-Aware Checkpoint/Restore Runtime for Agent Sandboxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.28138) — Session resume as a systems problem: replaying chat history recovers only a fraction of crashed sessions; real resume needs runtime-level checkpointing.

## Multi-Agent & Orchestration

- [Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08296) — When does adding agents help? Roughly: when the task decomposes and verification is centralized — the honest synthesis of both camps above.

## Sandboxing & Runtime Isolation

If your harness can run commands, it can run *bad* commands. The 2025-26 convergence: both major labs independently arrived at the same two-plane design — filesystem isolation plus a domain-allowlist egress proxy.

- [sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) — Anthropic. The open reference implementation of that two-plane design.
- [Making Claude Code more secure and autonomous through sandboxing](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing) — Anthropic. The companion post: proper sandboxing cut permission prompts by 84% — isolation *buys* autonomy rather than restricting it.
- [How we contain Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/how-we-contain-claude) — Anthropic. Containment across products, one level up from a single harness.
- [Codex sandboxing](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/sandbox.md) — OpenAI. The other lab's answer: Seatbelt on macOS, Landlock on Linux — worth reading side by side with Anthropic's.
- [A deep dive on agent sandboxes](https://pierce.dev/notes/a-deep-dive-on-agent-sandboxes) — Pierce Freeman. The taxonomy of isolation technologies (containers, gVisor, Firecracker, V8 isolates) from a harness builder's seat.
- [Iterating with shadow workspaces](https://cursor.com/blog/shadow-workspace) — Cursor. Isolation for a different reason: a hidden copy of the workspace where the agent can break things while getting real LSP feedback.
- [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B) — Sandboxed cloud runtimes for agent-generated code.
- [microsandbox](https://github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox) — Self-hosted microVM isolation with sub-200ms boot; the middle ground between containers-too-weak and VMs-too-slow.
- [Modal Sandboxes](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox) — Sandboxing as a serverless primitive; notable for making per-run isolation cheap enough to be the default.
- [Cua](https://github.com/trycua/cua) — Sandbox-per-run for computer-use agents: ephemeral macOS/Linux/Windows VMs that reset on every run, so agents are reproducible and the host stays untouched.
- [Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona) — Sandbox infrastructure purpose-built for agent workloads. Note: the open-source repo stopped receiving updates in mid-2026; evaluate accordingly.

## Safety, Permissions & Human-in-the-Loop

- [The Lethal Trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) — Simon Willison. Private data + untrusted content + external communication = exfiltration. The clearest threat model in the field.

- [Magentic-UI: Towards Human-in-the-loop Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22358) — Microsoft. Six concrete HITL mechanisms (co-planning, co-tasking, action guards…) as reusable design patterns, not ad-hoc confirm dialogs.

- [Claude Code Security Review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review) — Agentic security review as a GitHub Action.

Known gap we're tracking: agent identity, OAuth for tools, credential brokering, and secrets management — the auth layer of harness engineering has surprisingly little public writing. Contributions welcome.

## Protocols & Interop

The clearest structural story of 2026: the harness is decomposing into standardized interfaces — MCP for tools, ACP for editors, skills for procedures, AGENTS.md for repo conventions.

- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) — The standard for wiring tools and data into harnesses.
- [Official MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) — The namespace and discovery layer the ecosystem consolidated on.
- [One Year of MCP](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/) — The anniversary/spec-release post: what the protocol learned in production during its first year.

- [ContextForge MCP Gateway](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge) — IBM. The enterprise pattern: federate many MCP servers behind one gateway with central auth and audit.

## Skills & Progressive Disclosure

Loading every instruction upfront wastes context. Loading them on demand is a harness pattern in its own right.

- [OpenHands Skills](https://docs.openhands.dev/overview/skills) — The same progressive-disclosure idea in a second major harness — evidence the pattern is a standard, not a vendor feature.
- [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291) — The research ancestor: skill libraries that compose over time.

## Evaluation & Observability

You cannot tune a harness you cannot measure. Trajectory-level evaluation is a distinct problem from model benchmarking — and the benchmarks themselves are now under audit. This section holds the anchors; the full treatment lives in our sibling list, [awesome-agent-eval](https://github.com/Vendredi218/awesome-agent-eval).

- [Darwin Gödel Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954) — Sakana/UBC. Agents that rewrite their own harness code, validated empirically on coding benchmarks rather than by proof. The line of work Lilian Weng's post builds toward.

- [Trae Agent](https://github.com/bytedance/trae-agent) — ByteDance. Research-oriented coding agent with an ablation-friendly modular design.
- [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) — Block's extensible on-machine agent.
- [Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) — Building blocks for custom in-IDE assistants.
- [DeepSeek Harness (dsh)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) — Everything is a plugin, including the agent loop itself. There is deliberately no privileged core; the shipped coding agent is just one composition of swappable parts.
- [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) — The minimalist counterpoint: a thin core of four tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`) on the bet that frontier models already know what a coding agent is. Everything else lives in extensions you add deliberately.

- [Cage](https://github.com/vitalik1921/cage) — Vitaliy Shebela. Uses TypeScript contracts, invariant-to-test links, and content hashes to send stale or incomplete work back to Claude Code or Codex.

### Personal agents

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — The fastest-adopted harness in open-source history (380k+ stars within months of its late-2025 debut): local gateway control plane, messaging apps as the UI, memory as plain Markdown files, a heartbeat daemon for unprompted action.
- [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) — Nous Research. Harness-level self-improvement in practice: agent-curated memory, autonomous creation of reusable skills after complex tasks, full-text session search.

### Browser & computer use

- [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) — The dominant open browser harness: serialize the DOM into structured text with indexed interactive elements, so any LLM can act without vision.
- [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand) — Browserbase. Three primitives (act/observe/extract) over a Playwright-style API; choose per step between deterministic code and natural language, with caching and self-healing.
- [Skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern) — The vision-first counterpoint: vision LLMs plan over screenshots so automations survive site redesigns. AGPL-3.0 core with some capabilities held back for the proprietary cloud — a licensing pattern worth noticing.
- [Agent QA](https://github.com/vostride/agent-qa) — A TypeScript application-QA harness showing how persistent test memory, self-healing web/mobile flows, MCP tools, and evidence-backed failure triage fit into one runtime. Note the FSL-1.1-ALv2 license — source-available, converts to Apache-2.0 after two years.

### Deep research

- [GPT Researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher) — The longest-lived open deep-research harness: planner → parallel executors → publisher, with citation tracking throughout.
- [Open Deep Research](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research) — LangChain. Uniquely instructive because the repo preserves its own architectural evolution — three generations of deep-research design live side by side in one codebase.

### Voice

- [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) — The open standard for voice-agent orchestration: real-time pipelines where latency budgets, interruption handling, and turn-taking are the harness problems.
- [LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents) — The WebRTC-native alternative; read both to see how transport constraints reshape the agent loop.
- [Voice AI & Voice Agents: An Illustrated Primer](https://voiceaiandvoiceagents.com/) — The field guide to why voice harnesses are their own discipline.

### SDKs & runtimes

- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) — Graph-structured orchestration with explicit state.
- [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) — Handoffs, guardrails, and tracing as primitives.
- [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) — Type-safe agents; strong schema discipline.
- [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) — Hugging Face. The reference implementation of code-as-action in ~1,000 lines; agents emit Python instead of JSON tool calls, executed in pluggable sandboxes.
- [Google ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-python) — Code-first agent SDK with a graph workflow runtime: routing, fan-out/fan-in, loops, retry, HITL tool confirmation.
- [Strands Agents](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk) — AWS. Literally named "harness-sdk": build an agent harness and control it end-to-end, any model, any cloud.
- [AgentScope](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope) — Alibaba. Notable for real-time interruption and steering mid-loop as first-class primitives.
- [Youtu-Agent](https://github.com/TencentCloudADP/youtu-agent) — Tencent. Async simple-agent harness tuned for strong benchmark results with open-weight models.

### Comparative reading

- [DeepSeek Harness: Everything Is a Plugin](https://saikodev.ai/blog/deepseek-harness) — SaikoDev. A hands-on dsh walkthrough that turns into the sharpest architectural comparison available: dsh versus Pi as two opposite bets — structured addition against subtraction, and whether control over extending the system belongs to the developer ahead of time or to the agent at runtime.
- [How Claude Code is built](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-claude-code-is-built) — Pragmatic Engineer. The team's own account: TypeScript, aggressive dogfooding, and the harness rewritten by the agent it hosts.

## Contributing & Extension Ecosystems

How to actually get involved — the fastest way to learn harness engineering is to extend one. Full guide: [Contributing to Open-Source Harnesses](docs/contributing-to-open-harnesses.md).

The governance split that determines your strategy: **core-open** projects (OpenHands, Cline, Continue, Gemini CLI, Goose, Aider) take engine PRs; **ecosystem-first** projects (Claude Code, dsh, Codex) want you building on the extension surface instead.

- [Claude Code: Create plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) — Plugin format, `claude plugin validate`, and the community marketplace pipeline.

- [Codex: contributing policy](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) — The invited-PR model, stated plainly: root-cause analysis in an issue thread is the contribution they want.
- [OpenHands: extensions registry](https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions) — Lowest-friction real PR in the field: a SKILL.md directory plus one JSON entry.
- [Goose: Building custom extensions](https://goose-docs.ai/docs/tutorials/custom-extensions) — A Goose extension *is* an MCP server — the clearest demonstration that MCP is the cross-harness lingua franca.
- [Continue: customization](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/overview) — Blocks: models, rules, tools and prompts as shareable units on a hub.
